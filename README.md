Calico-clean
============

This is a simple Docker container and script that will check your currently running
Calico Nodes against Kubernetes Nodes to ensure extras don't exist.  

Creation of this was motivated by a temporary work around for [this.](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/3224)
